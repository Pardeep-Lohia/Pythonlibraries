# pathlib Learning Repository

## Overview
The `pathlib` module in Python provides an object-oriented interface for filesystem paths. Introduced in Python 3.4, it offers a more intuitive and cross-platform way to handle file and directory paths compared to traditional string-based methods using `os.path`.

## Why pathlib Exists
Before `pathlib`, Python developers relied on the `os.path` module for path manipulations, which often involved string operations that could be error-prone and platform-dependent. `pathlib` abstracts paths as objects, making code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors like incorrect path separators.

## When to Use It
Use `pathlib` whenever you need to:
- Manipulate file or directory paths
- Perform file system operations like reading, writing, or checking existence
- Build cross-platform applications
- Write cleaner, more Pythonic code for path handling
