# Python `shutil` Library Learning Repository

## Overview
The `shutil` module in Python provides a higher-level interface for file and directory operations. It offers functions for copying, moving, renaming, and removing files and directories, as well as utilities for archiving and disk usage inspection. As a built-in module, it simplifies common file system tasks that would otherwise require more complex code using lower-level modules like `os`.

## Why It Exists
`shutil` exists to provide a convenient, cross-platform way to perform high-level file operations. While `os` offers low-level system calls, `shutil` builds on top of these to provide ready-to-use functions for everyday file management tasks, reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.

## When to Use It
Use `shutil` when you need to:
- Copy files or entire directory trees
- Move or rename files and directories
- Create or extract archives (zip, tar, etc.)
- Remove directory trees recursively
- Check disk usage
- Perform bulk file operations in scripts or applications
- Build file management utilities or automation tools
