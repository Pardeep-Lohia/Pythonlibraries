# Python `sys` Library Learning Repository

## Overview
The `sys` module in Python provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is a built-in module that allows developers to manipulate the Python runtime environment, handle command-line arguments, manage input/output streams, and more.

## Why It Exists
`sys` exists to give Python programmers low-level access to the interpreter's internals. It bridges the gap between your code and the Python runtime, enabling control over execution flow, environment inspection, and system-level interactions without external libraries.

## When to Use It
Use `sys` when you need to:
- Access command-line arguments passed to a script
- Redirect or manipulate standard input/output/error streams
- Inspect or modify interpreter settings
- Handle runtime exceptions or exits gracefully
- Monitor memory usage or recursion limits
- Interact with the Python environment in a cross-platform way

## How to Navigate This Repository
This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive learning path for the `sys` library:

- **theory/**: Conceptual explanations and background
- **capabilities/**: High-level overview of what `sys` enables
- **functions/**: Detailed documentation of key functions and attributes
- **implementations/**: Runnable Python code examples
- **examples/**: Real-world script demonstrations
- **best_practices/**: Guidelines and common pitfalls
- **interview/**: Theory and coding questions for preparation
- **cheatsheet/**: Quick reference guide

Start with the theory files for foundational knowledge, then explore functions and implementations. Use examples for practical application and best practices for production-ready code.
